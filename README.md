# Makeover Monday

## Goal

Take a dataset and its visualization https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/ and recreate it or improve it.

## My Choice

I chose a dataset that seeks to answer the following question: _**What do Americans think about abortion?**_.

## The Makeover

The original data visualization's background was too saturated and there seemed to be random numbers denoting random percentages throughout the plot. I feel like both were unnecessary so I fixed them. Likewise, the line style and colors of the plot, I believe, seek to convey a broader political statement that is unnecessary. I did my best to choose colors and line styles that are morally neutral.
